# OpenBlok themes

This repository collects the community themes created for [OpenBlok](https://github.com/mmatyas/openblok), to make finding and installing them easier. You can find previews and downloads below.


### Where's my theme directory?

To install themes, you have to find your theme directory first:

- on Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/openblok/themes`
- on Windows: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\openblok\themes`

Note that the `themes` sub-folder may not exist, in this case, just create a new empty directory there with the name `themes`.


### How can I use a theme?

Simply download the ZIP file of your selected theme, and extract it to your theme directory. Then you can change the current theme in the options menu.


### How can I download all themes at once?

You can use Git to download this whole repository, for example:

```
cd $HOME/.local/share/openblok
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mmatyas/openblok-themes.git themes
```
